# Building Microservices with Node, Docker and Nginx
1. What is a Microservice
2. How do we make one?
3. How do we make them work together?

## Notes (Opinionated)
DO NOT do this for a real project of this size, this is to learn.
A Microservice architecture is for BIG projects with a lot of people.

People will tell you that you can do it at small scale and it is true
but you can also remove ants with a nuclear bomb.

Docker containers can be used without using Microservices, they are not the
same thing!

This is the most common way I see people build container based projects
but my personal favourite is using a queue for all container to container
communication.

## Rule of thumb thoughts (Opinionated)
Docker containers = good for almost all project sizes
Microservices = good for big companies with a lot of code and people
Sweetspot = Monolith app and databases in containers

## Tests
