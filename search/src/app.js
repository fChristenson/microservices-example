/*
  Calling other services from a service is dangerous.
  If those services make their own calls there is a chance
  that you will get a circular call chain or that every request
  will take a lot of time.
  
  However crosscutting services such as this have to do it
  so this makes it very important to have the 1 hop rule or
  a message queue for all service to service communication.
  
  The 1 hop rule is that a service can not start a call chain
  longer than 1, here it is ok because:
  "search -> books|videos -> <no more calls>"
